## How Dark mode works

For this tiny project i have implemented easily the dark mode, using only one javascript function to toggle the theme, and some css code.

- For this we have to know the css color-scheme property. This feature changes the inputs accent color, font color and background color of the whole document or in a specific element, this css property just accepts two values, light or dark

- example:

```css
* {
  color-scheme: dark;
}
```
